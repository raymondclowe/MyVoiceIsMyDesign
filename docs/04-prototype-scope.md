# Prototype Scope Document

## Purpose
This document defines the boundaries and specific requirements for the initial MyVoiceIsMyDesign prototype. It outlines what features will be included, the expected user flow, technical constraints, and success metrics.

## Core Features for Initial Prototype

### User Interface
- Two-panel layout with clear separation of controls and 3D preview
- Minimal, clean design focusing on the essential elements:
  - Voice input button/microphone
  - Text display area for voice recognition results
  - 3D preview area with a default cube
  - Export button
  - Configuration section for API key

### Voice Input
- Basic voice-to-text functionality using Web Speech API
- Text display of recognized speech
- Simple text input as fallback
- Basic voice output in initial prototype using web text to speech

### AI Integration
- Support for a single AI provider (initially OpenAI or similar)
- Basic prompt engineering for simple shape generation
- User-provided API key configuration
- Minimal error handling for failed API calls

### 3D Modeling
- Basic three.js implementation
- Simple primitive shape generation (cube, sphere, cylinder)
- Basic camera controls (rotate, zoom)
- Single object modeling (no multi-part assemblies)
- Standard lighting setup

### Export Functionality
- Basic STL export
- Simple download functionality
- Minimal printability checks (basic validation only)
- No slicing integration

## User Flow

1. **Initial Load**
   - User arrives at the application
   - Default cube is displayed in the 3D preview area
   - Welcome message prompts user to describe what they want to create

2. **Configuration**
   - User enters their API key in the configuration section
   - Application validates the key

3. **Model Creation**
   - User clicks the microphone button
   - User verbally describes the desired model
   - Text appears in the display area showing the recognized speech
   - User confirms or edits the text if needed

4. **AI Processing**
   - Application sends the description to the AI
   - Loading indicator shows processing status
   - AI generates the three.js code for the model

5. **Model Preview**
   - Generated model appears in the 3D preview area
   - User can rotate and zoom to inspect the model
   - User can verbally request changes if needed and loop back to the AI processing step

6. **Export**
   - User indicates they are satisfied with the model
   - User clicks the export button
   - Basic printability check is performed
   - STL file is generated and downloaded

## Technical Constraints

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers only (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No support for Internet Explorer
- Desktop-focused, with basic mobile responsiveness

### Performance Limitations
- Simple models only (under 1,000 polygons)
- No configurable colors or textures as these don't print
- No complex animations
- Single object per scene

### AI Limitations
- Basic shape generation only
- Limited understanding of complex geometric descriptions
- No support for style transfer or advanced features
- Dependent on user's API key and quota

### Data Storage
- Local browser storage only
- No cloud saving
- No user accounts or authentication
- Session-based model retention

## Excluded Features
The following features are explicitly NOT included in the initial prototype:

- User accounts and authentication
- Cloud storage of models
- Multi-part assemblies
- Advanced texturing and materials
- Slicing integration
- Community features
- Undo/redo functionality
- History tracking
- Advanced printability analysis
- Mobile-optimized experience

## Success Metrics

### Functional Success
- User can successfully create a basic 3D model using voice input
- Model can be exported as a valid STL file
- Application runs without critical errors in supported browsers

### User Experience Success
- First-time users can complete the full workflow without external guidance
- Voice recognition accurately captures user descriptions
- Generated models reasonably match user descriptions
- UI is intuitive and self-explanatory

### Technical Success
- Application loads in under 3 seconds on average connections
- Activity indicator shows AI model output being streamed so user understands it takes a long time
- STL export completes in under 3 seconds
- Application functions on all target browsers

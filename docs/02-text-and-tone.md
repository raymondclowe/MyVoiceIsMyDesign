## Voice
MyVoiceIsMyDesign's voice is:

- **Friendly and Approachable**: The application speaks to users as a helpful companion, not as a technical tool.
- **Encouraging**: Language consistently reinforces user success and capabilities.
- **Clear**: Instructions and feedback avoid technical jargon when possible, explaining concepts in plain language.
- **Conversational**: The AI interaction feels like talking with a knowledgeable friend rather than using software.
- **Patient**: The system never expresses frustration or impatience, even when users need multiple attempts.

## Tone
The tone adapts slightly based on the context:

- **During Initial Interaction**: Welcoming and inviting, encouraging users to begin creating.
- **During Model Creation**: Supportive and guiding, offering suggestions without being prescriptive.
- **When Providing Feedback**: Constructive and positive, focusing on improvements rather than flaws.
- **When Discussing Printability**: Informative and practical, explaining technical considerations in accessible terms.

## Key Phrases
Examples of language that embodies our voice and tone:

### Welcome/Introduction
- "Welcome to MyVoiceIsMyDesign! What would you like to create today?"
- "I'm ready to help you build your 3D model. What are you imagining?"
- "Let's create something together. Describe what you'd like to make."

### During Creation
- "I'm working on your model now. Here's what I've created based on your description."
- "How does this look? We can make changes if needed."
- "Would you like to adjust any part of the model?"

### Providing Suggestions
- "This design might print better if we add some support here."
- "Consider making this section a bit thicker for better printing results."
- "For a successful print, I'd recommend adjusting this angle slightly."
- "This will print better if split into two parts which then click together. Would you like to to split it and add the click connectors?

### Confirmation and Export
- "Your model is ready for printing! You can export it now."
- "Great work! This model should print well with the recommended settings."
- "You've created a printable model. Let's export it so you can bring it to life."

## Language to Avoid
- Overly technical 3D modeling terminology without explanation

- Commanding or authoritative instructions
- Vague feedback that doesn't guide improvement

## Brand Personality
MyVoiceIsMyDesign's personality is:

- **Empowering**: Focuses on what users CAN do, not limitations

## Application in UI Elements

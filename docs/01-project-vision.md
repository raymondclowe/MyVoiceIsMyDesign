# MyVoiceIsMyDesign - MVP Prototype Document

## Core Concept

MyVoiceIsMyDesign is a web-based 3D editor designed specifically for novice 3D printer enthusiasts. It enables users to create 3D models for printing through an intuitive, voice-controlled interface powered by AI. The application uses three.js for rendering and modeling, allowing users to verbally describe what they want to build and see it materialize in real-time.

The key innovation is the combination of:
- Voice input/output for natural interaction
- AI assistance to interpret user intent and generate models
- Real-time 3D preview using three.js
- Printability analysis to ensure successful 3D printing

## Target User

Our primary users are:
- 3D printer enthusiasts who have limited experience with 3D modeling software
- People who can verbally express what they want to create but lack the technical skills to use traditional 3D modeling tools
- Hobbyists who want to quickly prototype ideas without learning complex software

## Value Proposition

MyVoiceIsMyDesign solves several key problems:
1. **Reduces the technical barrier** to 3D modeling for printing
2. **Bridges the gap** between a user's mental image and a printable 3D model
3. **Eliminates the frustration** of learning complex 3D modeling software
4. **Provides immediate feedback** on printability and design improvements
5. **Creates a sense of accomplishment** by enabling users to successfully create printable models
6. **Generic** equally useful for someone who wants to make functional prints (e.g. a door hook or replacement cooker knob) or someone who wants to make decorative prints (e.g. a figurine)

## Overall Aesthetic

The application will feature:
- Clean, minimalist interface with focus on the 3D model
- Two-panel layout: interaction panel on the left, 3D preview on the right
- Modern, accessible design with clear visual hierarchy
- Subtle visual cues to guide users through the modeling process
- Responsive feedback to indicate AI processing and model updates

## Technology Approach

- **Frontend Only**: Pure HTML/JavaScript implementation without backend dependencies
- **Local Processing**: All 3D modeling happens in the user's browser
- **API Integration**: Connects to standard AI language models (OpenAI, Open Router, Google AI)
- **User-Provided Keys**: Users bring their own API keys for AI services
- **Local Storage**: Models and settings stored in browser local storage

## Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful if:
1. Users can verbally describe a simple object and see it rendered in 3D
2. The generated models are printable with minimal adjustments
3. Users report feeling empowered and successful in creating 3D models
4. The workflow is intuitive enough that users can complete a model without extensive instructions

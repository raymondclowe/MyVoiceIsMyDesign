# Documentation & Workflow Document

## Purpose
This document outlines the development process for the MyVoiceIsMyDesign application, including how the documentation should be used, version control practices, review processes, and feedback incorporation.

## Document Usage Guidelines

### Intended Audience
- **Development Team**: Primary users of all documentation
- **Designers**: Focus on Design Mockups and Text & Tone documents
- **Project Managers**: Focus on Project Vision, To-Do, and Prototype Scope documents
- **Testers**: Focus on Prototype Scope and To-Do documents

### Document Hierarchy
1. **Project Vision Document**: The foundation document that all other documents must align with
2. **Prototype Scope Document**: Defines the boundaries of what will be built
3. **To-Do Document**: Provides the specific tasks to accomplish the scope
4. **Design Mockups**: Visual representation of the application
5. **Text & Tone Document**: Guidelines for all text within the application
6. **Workflow Document**: Meta-document about the development process

### Branching Strategy
- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/[feature-name]**: Individual feature development
- **bugfix/[bug-name]**: Bug fixes
- **docs/[doc-name]**: Documentation updates

### Commit Message Format
```
[type]: [short description]

[detailed description]

[issue reference]
```

Types:
- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **test**: Adding tests

## Review Process

### Document Reviews
1. **Initial Draft**: Created by the responsible team member
2. **Peer Review**: At least one other team member reviews
3. **Stakeholder Review**: Project manager or product owner reviews
4. **Final Approval**: Team lead or project manager approves
5. **Version Update**: Document version is incremented

### Code Reviews
1. **Self-Review**: Developer reviews their own code before submission
2. **Automated Checks**: Linting, tests, and CI processes run
3. **Peer Review**: At least one other developer reviews the code
4. **Approval**: Reviewer approves the changes
5. **Merge**: Changes are merged into the develop branch

### Review Checklist
- Does it align with the Project Vision?
- Does it stay within the Prototype Scope?
- Does it follow the design guidelines?
- Does it use appropriate text and tone?
- Is it well-documented?
- Does it pass all tests?

## Feedback Incorporation

### User Feedback Collection
- **Initial Testing**: Internal team testing with direct feedback
- **Alpha Testing**: Limited external users with structured feedback forms
- **Beta Testing**: Wider audience with in-app feedback mechanisms

### Feedback Prioritization
1. **Critical Issues**: Bugs that prevent core functionality
2. **User Experience Issues**: Problems that significantly impact usability
3. **Enhancement Requests**: New features or improvements
4. **Visual/Design Feedback**: Aesthetic improvements

### Feedback Implementation Process
1. **Collection**: Feedback is collected and documented
2. **Triage**: Feedback is categorized and prioritized
3. **Planning**: High-priority items are added to the backlog
4. **Implementation**: Feedback is addressed in future iterations
5. **Validation**: Changes are verified with users who provided feedback

## Development Workflow

1. Create code locally, should run locally
2. Deploy to github
3. Use github pages integration with cloudflare to host static site


### Sprint Structure
- **Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Planning**: Beginning of sprint
- **Daily Standups**: Brief daily check-ins
- **Review**: End of sprint demonstration
- **Retrospective**: Process improvement discussion

### Development Phases for MVP

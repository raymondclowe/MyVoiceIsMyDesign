# Project Roadmap - Voice-to-3D Design Prototype

## Phase 1: Core Functionality (2 weeks)
- [ ] Implement basic voice command recognition
- [ ] Set up three.js scene with basic primitives
- [ ] Create voice-to-shape mapping system
- [ ] Develop basic 3D manipulation commands

## Phase 2: Enhanced Features (2 weeks)
- [ ] Add advanced shape generation
- [ ] Implement material and texture controls
- [ ] Develop scene management system
- [ ] Create export functionality (STL format)

## Phase 3: Refinement (1 week)
- [ ] Optimize voice recognition accuracy
- [ ] Improve 3D rendering performance
- [ ] Add undo/redo functionality
- [ ] Implement basic error handling

## Future Considerations
- Multi-user collaboration
- AI-assisted design suggestions
- Advanced lighting controls
- Animation capabilities

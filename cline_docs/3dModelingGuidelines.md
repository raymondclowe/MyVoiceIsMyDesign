# 3D Modeling Guidelines

## Geometry Creation
- Use parametric shapes for basic objects
- Maintain clean topology
- Optimize polygon count
- Use instancing for repeated objects

## Material System
- PBR materials for realism
- Texture resolution optimization
- Material reuse and sharing
- LOD (Level of Detail) implementation

## Scene Organization
- Logical grouping of objects
- Clear naming conventions
- Layer-based organization
- Scene graph optimization

## Performance Considerations
- Frustum culling
- Occlusion culling
- Texture compression
- Light baking

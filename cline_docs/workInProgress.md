# Work In Progress

## Current Status
- Project setup completed with testing infrastructure (Jest, Puppeteer)
- Basic file structure established for voice, 3D, and AI components
- Documentation framework in place

## Ongoing Tasks
- Implementing voice recognition interface
- Setting up three.js scene management
- Developing AI processing pipeline for voice commands
- Creating testing framework for all components

## Next Steps
- Complete voice recognition module with Web Speech API
- Implement basic 3D scene with three.js
- Connect voice input to AI processing
- Develop initial 3D model generation from voice commands

## Known Issues
- Need to optimize performance for complex 3D models
- Voice recognition accuracy needs improvement
- AI processing latency needs to be reduced

## Recent Changes
- Added testing infrastructure with Jest
- Created basic component structure
- Established documentation framework

## Notes
- Focus on modular design to allow for easy component replacement
- Prioritize voice recognition accuracy over feature completeness
- Consider browser compatibility for Web Speech API implementation
